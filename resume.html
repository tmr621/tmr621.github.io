  <h2>Some things I’ve worked on:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>College Board:</strong> My current role, I work as a corporate strategy analyst, sitting within the Office of the CTO & providing strategic analysis and insight into partnerships, acquisitions, process management, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Astrum Solar (acquired by Direct Energy):</strong> Got hired by a start up that was in the process of getting bought, to have someone to scale their business processes & software systems once the parent company injected a ton of cash into the business. I owned all operations related processes (project management, back office systems, etc). Left this role to go to business school.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lumber Liquidators:</strong> When I was hired, inventory forecasting was done through the buying team just kind of making stuff up. I took previous sales history, promotional history, and a bunch of binary variables and used regression analysis to develop category level demand models. I then wrote a bunch of VBA code (yay Excel!) to automate demand forecasting and to suggest ordering plans based on those forecasts. I was responsible for ~25% of sale mix, and ~50% of sku mix.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Some Other Stuff:</h2>

      I worked with Fluence Energy to show that solar + storage energy generation can compete with certain kinds of natural gas peaker plants.
